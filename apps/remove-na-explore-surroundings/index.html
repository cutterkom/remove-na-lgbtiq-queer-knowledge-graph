<p>This page is used to take a look at the data of the Remove NA project. All of the people in this queer history dataset did not exist on their own. They were (and are, not all are dead) surrounded with other people they loved, collaborated with, were persecuted by, were inspired and inspired. This application is designed to help show all these different type of surroundings of person - both positive and negative.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the <strong>definition of a companion</strong> is: <strong>Someone appears in connection with the person in focus either in Factgrid, the database for historical projects, Wikidata or Wikipedia</strong>. Technically this page utilizes federated queries starting at the <a href="https://database.factgrid.de/query/">Factgrid SPARQL Endpoint</a>.</p>

Weird results?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Occasionally, results appear that are clearly not people. For example, “Germany”. This happens because in DBPedia some entities are of <code>type: Person</code>, although there is no apparent plausibility for this. Unfortunately, I have neither an explanation nor an influence on that data modeling decision. Also, there seems to be a bug in DBPedia: Some items are incorrectly linked to Achille Fould (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Stefan_Zweig">Stefan Zweig</a> and <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Barbara_Hammer">Barbara Hammer</a>). I informed the DBPedia on that issue.</p>
