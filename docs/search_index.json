This page will serve as the technical documentation. 1.1 Virtual Environments and dependency management Python venv R: renv.lock (one has to activate it with renv::activate()), see more in docs "],["data-gathering.html", "2 Data Gathering 2.1 Infrastructure 2.2 Citavi data dumps 2.3 Entity Resolution", " 2 Data Gathering The first step is to merge different data sources. The scripts for this can be found in the repo under data-gathering. 2.1 Infrastructure 2.1.1 MariaDB Initial converted data from Citavi and other sources are stored in a MariaDB.

A first setup to tackle the task is two-fold: Calculate text similarities between entitity stings based on cosine similarity Human decision making 2.3.1 Calculate text similarities between entitity stings based on cosine similarity based on quanteda scripts under data-gathering/entity-resolution cosine minimum similiarty is set to 0.75 (for authors and publishers from posters and books) 2.3.2 Human decision making Shiny app called “Who is Who?” to show possible matching candidates decision by button clicking code in apps/entity-resolver results saved in er_candidates "],["data-modelling.html", "3 Data Modelling 3.1 Create RDF files from database", " 3 Data Modelling In this document you’ll find explainations and descriptions of the data model used in the Remove NA project.
