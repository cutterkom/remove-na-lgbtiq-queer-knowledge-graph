# Intro

I will be allowed to spend a larger part of 2022 building a Knowledge Graph on queer history.
This page will serve as the technical documentation.


## Virtual Environments and dependency management

* Python `venv`
* R: `renv.lock` (one has to activate it with `renv::activate()`), [see more in docs](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)
