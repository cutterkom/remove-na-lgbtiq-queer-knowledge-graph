# Data Modelling

In this document you'll find explainations and descriptions of the data model used in the `Remove NA` project.

Remove NA collects data about real world entities, such as people, organizations or locations, and the relationships between them.


## Create RDF files from database

RDF files created with `RML` rules.

Scripts in `data-modelling`

1. run parser:
  - Knowledge Graph v1 with de-duplicated books, authors, publishers (best version!): `yarrrml-parser -i mappings/kg_v1.yml -o mappings/kg_v1.r2rml.ttl -f R2RML`
  - for posters: `yarrrml-parser -i mappings/posters-rules.yml -o mappings/posters-mapping.r2rml.ttl -f R2RML`
  - for books: `yarrrml-parser -i mappings/books-rules.yml -o mappings/books-mapping.r2rml.ttl -f R2RML`
  - for books and authors `yarrrml-parser -i mappings/books-authors.yml -o mappings/books-authors.r2rml.ttl -f R2RML`

2. create RDF files with `python3 create-rdf.py`
