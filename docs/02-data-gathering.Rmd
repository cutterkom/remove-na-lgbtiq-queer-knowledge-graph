# Data Gathering

The first step is to merge different data sources. 
The scripts for this can be found in the repo under `data-gathering`.


## Infrastructure

### MariaDB

Initial converted data from Citavi and other sources are stored in a MariaDB.
Install and setup on [Mac with `homebrew`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-on-macos-using-homebrew/).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lgbtiq_kg 
  CHARACTER SET = 'utf8'
  COLLATE = 'utf8_german2_ci';
  
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW_PASSWORD';
```

## Citavi-Daten

Scripts: `data-gathering/from-citavi/`

There are three exports from Citavi databases that are normalized: `poster`, `books`, `digital`. 
All three are stored in a MariaDB.

Naming convention: 

* plurale: data -> `books_years`
* singular: relations -> `book_years`: relationship between `book_id` and `year_id`
