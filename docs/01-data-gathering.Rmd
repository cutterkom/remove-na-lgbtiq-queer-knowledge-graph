# Data Gathering

The first step is to merge different data sources. 
The scripts for this can be found in the repo under `data-gathering`.


## Infrastructure

### MariaDB

Initial converted data from Citavi and other sources are stored in a MariaDB.
Install and setup on [Mac with `homebrew`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-on-macos-using-homebrew/).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lgbtiq_kg 
  CHARACTER SET = 'utf8'
  COLLATE = 'utf8_german2_ci';
  
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW_PASSWORD';
```

## Citavi data dumps

Scripts: `data-gathering/from-citavi/`

There are three exports from Citavi data dumps that are normalized: `poster`, `books`, `digital`. 
All three are stored in a MariaDB.

Naming convention: 

* plurale: data -> `books_years`
* singular: relations -> `book_years`: relationship between `book_id` and `year_id`

#### Poster data model

### Views

#### Books

A wide view on all books

```sql
CREATE VIEW books_wide AS
SELECT 
books.book_id, 
books_authors.author_id,
books_editors.editor_id,
books_locations.location_id,
books_publishers.publisher_id,
books_series.series_id,
books_years.year_id,
books.name, 
books_authors.author,
books.isbn,
books.subtitle, 
books.title_supplement,
books_editors.editor,
books_locations.location,
books_publishers.publisher,
books_series.series,
books_years.year
FROM books
-- add authors
LEFT JOIN book_author ON books.book_id = book_author.book_id
LEFT JOIN books_authors ON book_author.author_id = books_authors.author_id
-- add editors
LEFT JOIN book_editor ON books.book_id= book_editor.book_id
LEFT JOIN books_editors ON book_editor.editor_id = books_editors.editor_id
-- add locatiONs
LEFT JOIN book_locatiON ON books.book_id= book_locatiON.book_id
LEFT JOIN books_locatiONs ON book_locatiON.locatiON_id = books_locatiONs.locatiON_id
-- add publishers
LEFT JOIN book_publisher ON books.book_id= book_publisher.book_id
LEFT JOIN books_publishers ON book_publisher.publisher_id = books_publishers.publisher_id
-- add series
LEFT JOIN book_series ON books.book_id= book_series.book_id
LEFT JOIN books_series ON book_series.series_id = books_series.series_id
-- add years
LEFT JOIN book_year ON books.book_id= book_year.book_id
LEFT JOIN books_years ON book_year.year_id = books_years.year_id;
```
#### Posters

Wide View on posters data.

```sql
CREATE VIEW posters_wide AS
SELECT 
posters.poster_id,
posters_authors.author_id,
posters_years.year_id,
posters_keywords.keyword_id,
posters.title,
posters.size,
posters_authors.author,
posters_years.year,
posters_keywords.keyword

FROM posters
-- add authors
LEFT JOIN poster_author ON posters.poster_id = poster_author.poster_id
LEFT JOIN posters_authors ON posters_authors.author_id = poster_author.author_id
-- add years
LEFT JOIN poster_year ON posters.poster_id = poster_year.poster_id
LEFT JOIN posters_years ON posters_years.year_id = poster_year.year_id
-- add keywords
LEFT JOIN poster_keyword ON posters.poster_id = poster_keyword.poster_id
LEFT JOIN posters_keywords ON posters_keywords.keyword_id = poster_keyword.keyword_id
;
```

## Entity Resolution

Deduplication, entitiy resolultion, entity linking etc. is a main and re-accuring task in this project. 

A first setup to tackle the task is two-fold: 

1. Calculate text similarities between entitity stings based on cosine similarity
2. Human decision making

### Calculate text similarities between entitity stings based on cosine similarity

* based on `quanteda`
* scripts under `data-gathering/entity-resolution`
* cosine minimum similiarty is set to 0.75 (for authors and publishers from posters and books)

### Human decision making

* Shiny app called "Who is Who?" to show possible matching candidates
* decision by button clicking
* code in `apps/entity-resolver`
* results saved in `er_candidates`

![](img/who-is-who-ex.png)


### Adding new candidates

To update the Shiny app in order to resolve new candidates these two steps are needed: 

* get new additional_infos in get-additional-infos.R
* add new source to get_candidates_names()

## New database with cleaned entries

In `lgbtiq_kg_clean` live all deduplicated entities.
So to say the end result of all scripts in `data-gathering/entitiy-resolution`

View `books_wide`: 

```sql

CREATE VIEW books_wide AS
SELECT 
entities.id, 
books_authors.book_id, 
entities.name, 
books.name AS title,
books.subtitle,
books.isbn
FROM entities
INNER JOIN books_authors ON entities.id = books_authors.id
LEFT JOIN books ON books.book_id = books_authors.book_id;
```

View `psoters_wide`: 
```sql
CREATE VIEW posters_wide AS
SELECT DISTINCT
entities.id, 
posters_authors.poster_id, 
entities.name,
posters.title,
posters.short_title,
posters.filename,
posters.size,
posters_years.year
FROM entities
INNER JOIN posters_authors ON entities.id = posters_authors.id
LEFT JOIN posters ON posters.poster_id = posters_authors.poster_id
LEFT JOIN posters_years ON posters.poster_id = posters_years.year_id;;

```


View `entities_per_type`: Which entity appears where?

```sql
CREATE VIEW entities_per_type AS
SELECT 
entities.id, 
entities.name,
books_authors.book_id,
posters_authors.poster_id 
FROM entities
LEFT JOIN books_authors ON entities.id = books_authors.id
LEFT JOIN posters_authors ON entities.id = posters_authors.id;
```
