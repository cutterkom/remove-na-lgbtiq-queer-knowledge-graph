# Remove NA

This repository is the central hub for everything related to the "Remove NA" project.
The goal is to create a LGBTIQ* knowledge graph based on data of a community archive in Munich called [Forum Queeres Archiv MÃ¼nchen](https://forummuenchen.org/en/english/). 
We collect cultural heritage on queer history, especially in Munich and Bavaria/Germany.

**More on the project:**

* [Remove NA: Warum ich einen LGBTIQ*-Knowledge Graph bauen werde](https://katharinabrunner.de/2022/03/remove-na-ein-lgbtiq-knowledge-graph/)

## Repository Layout

* `data-gathering`: contains the scripts in the data collection process from various, heterogeneous data sources
* `data-linking`: 
* `docs`: technical documentation based on `bookdown`

## Update documentation

```r
bookdown::render_book("docs", "bookdown::gitbook", output_dir = ".")
```
