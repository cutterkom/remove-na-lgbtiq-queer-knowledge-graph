# Remove NA

This repository is the central hub for everything related to the "Remove NA" project.
The goal is to create a LGBTIQ* knowledge graph based on data of a community archive in Munich called [Forum Queeres Archiv München](https://forummuenchen.org/en/english/). 
We collect cultural heritage on queer history, especially in Munich and Bavaria/Germany.
