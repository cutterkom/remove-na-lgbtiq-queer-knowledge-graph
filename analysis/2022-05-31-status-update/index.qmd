It's the end of May, halfway through the time I officially have for my Prototype Fund project. What is the status? Pretty good. I've consolidated a lot of the data from different, heterogeneous sources.

This post is intended to provide an overview of the current state of the linked open data base.

## Short Recap

The data is [stored and published in Factgrid](https://katharinabrunner.de/2022/05/vom-rechner-in-die-welt-notizen-zum-ersten-grossen-import-in-factgrid/), a database for historians. The software is Wikibase, so the same as Wikidata only as a separate installation. This also means: The properties are different. An example: The elementary property "instance of" (such as person, event, organization...) is [P31 in Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31), [P2 in Factgrid](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Property:P2).

Everything else besides the specific data modeling works similar, like the data import via [Quickstatements](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements) or the query via a SPARQL endpoint. I now use this endpoint to give an overview of how much data is in Factgrid as of today.

## Summary of imported data

```{r warning=F, message=F }
library(tidyverse)
library(kabrutils)
library(SPARQL)

config_file <- "../../data-publishing/factgrid/config.yml"
config <- yaml::read_yaml(config_file)

# fetch all items from RemoveNA Project and get the statement count
query <- '
SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?statementcount
WHERE {
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
  ?item wdt:P131 wd:Q400012 .
  ?item wikibase:statements ?statementcount.
}'

query_res <- query %>%
  sparql_to_tibble(endpoint = config$connection$sparql_endpoint)

# Number of items ---------------------------------------------------------

nr_of_items <- length(unique(query_res$item))

# Number of relations -----------------------------------------------------

gross_relations <- sum(query_res$statementcount)

# redundandt: 4098 for works (posters/books)
redundant_works <- 4098

# minus 3 meta data items per item
netto_relations <- gross_relations - (nr_of_items*3) - redundant_works
```

In summary:

**As of today, I imported `r nr_of_items` Items with `r as.character(netto_relations)` relations between them.**

Gross there are more connections, but since each item has three metadata fields ([1](), [2](), [3]()), I leave them out of the count. Also, I remove [Published works](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Property:P174), because it can be interpreted as a duplicated count for those.

| Type                           | value                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Items                          | `r nr_of_items`                   |
| Gross relations                | `r gross_relations`               |
| redundant data on poster/books | `r redundant_works`               |
| standard metadata              | `r as.character(nr_of_items*3)`   |
| Net relations                  | `r as.character(netto_relations)` |

## A network of all data

Plotting all relations between items that belong to the Remove NA project:

Looks quite nice!

But besides looks, what does it mean?

It's obvious that many, many items converge to a handful items. You can see this through the lines that end in just few points. For example many items have [`author`](https://database.factgrid.de/entity/Q23190) as a [`career statement`](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Item:Q37073) or [`LGBT`](https://database.factgrid.de/entity/Q399988) as [`target group`](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Property:P573).

What are those items?

## Main targeted objects

The table shows how often a statement points to a certain object (top 50):

```{r}
query <- '
# get a count of target items (objects)
# removing standard properties
SELECT ?value ?valueLabel ?count WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?value (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?count) WHERE {
       ?item wdt:P131 wd:Q400012 .
       ?item ?prop ?value . 
      # only entities as targets, no strings
      FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?value), "https://database.factgrid.de/entity/"))
      # without standard properties like instance of, and research project stuff
      MINUS {?item wdt:P2 ?value.}
      MINUS {?item wdt:P131 ?value.}
      MINUS {?item wdt:P97 ?value.}
            
    } GROUP BY ?value
  } . 
  SERVICE wikibase:label {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" .
  }
}
ORDER BY DESC(?count) 
Limit 50
'

query %>% 
  sparql_to_tibble(endpoint = config$connection$sparql_endpoint) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

A deeper network analysis is ongoing.

## Count of `instances of` in the data

`Instances of` are the most basic property in Factgrid as well as Wikidata. It gives information about what an item is: A human? A group? A demonstration? ...

The table shows how often an instance occurs:

```{r fetch_count_ofinstances}
query <- '
#  Query to find the most common values for the property ?prop
#  on items in the class ?class

SELECT ?value ?valueLabel ?count WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?value (COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) AS ?count) WHERE {
       ?a ?prop ?value . 
       ?a wdt:P131 ?class .
       BIND (wdt:P2 AS ?prop) .
       BIND (wd:Q400012 AS ?class) .
    } GROUP BY ?value
  } . 
  SERVICE wikibase:label {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" .
  }
}
ORDER BY DESC(?count) ?valueLabel
'

query %>% 
  sparql_to_tibble(endpoint = config$connection$sparql_endpoint) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```
